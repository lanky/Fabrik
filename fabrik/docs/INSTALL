# deployment instructions.
1. ensure the required software packages are installed. Some of these are from EPEL.
   # the EPEL version of Django is older than this. Custom packages may be required.
   # django builds easily enough on RHEL from the fedora src RPM
   Django > 1.2
   python
   python-simplejson (for JSON conversions.)
   httpd
   mod_wsgi (the successor to mod_python)
   cobbler >= 2.0.9 (2.0.10 is expected in the repos soon and 2.0.11 soon afterwards)


1. checkout the fabrik 'trunk' branch somewhere safe (although directly into /opt/webapps also will be fine)


2. create needed directories:
# the install command allows me to specify perms and ownership upon creation
install -o root -g apache -m 2775 -d /var/www/html/pub
install -g apache -m 2775  /var/lib/cobbler/snippets/disklayouts/custom
# plus the Django root
mkdir /opt/webapps

3. Deploy files into the appropriate directories:
cp -av fabrik/ media/ wsgi *.py /opt/webapps/
(actually, it'd be simpler to copy everything into /opt/webapps, which ensures nothing is missing.)

4. create the (currently) required xmlrpcuser in cobbler
the default in config.py is xmlrpc/r3dhat01.
as long as they are the same there as in cobbler, all should be well.

5. install snippets etc for cobbler.

6. (re)start apache/cobblerd

6. in your browser du jour, navigate to 
http://yournewserver/apps/fabrik and be amazed.
