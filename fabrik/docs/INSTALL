Deployment instructions.
========================

For the time being these are manual, but eventually this will be packaged using
python-distutils or setuptools

Software Requirements
---------------------

**note**
The EPEL version of Django is older than this. Custom packages may be required.
django builds easily enough on RHEL from the fedora src RPM

* Django > 1.2
* python
* On earlier versions of python you may require:
* python-simplejson (for JSON conversions.)
* httpd
* mod_wsgi (the successor to mod_python)
* cobbler >= 2.0.9 (2.0.10 is expected in the repos soon and 2.0.11 soon afterwards)


Code Checkouts
--------------
Checkout the fabrik master (or a tag of your choice) branch somewhere safe
(although directly into it's destination dir (default: /opt/webapps) also will be fine

Filesystem Prep
---------------

The install command allows me to specify perms and ownership upon creation
<pre>
install -o root -g apache -m 2775 -d /var/www/html/pub
install -g apache -m 2775  /var/lib/cobbler/snippets/disklayouts/custom
install -d /opt/webapps
</pre>

Deploy files into the appropriate directories
---------------------------------------------

Here we are assuming you checked out fabrik somewhere other than its destination dir.
<pre>
cp -av fabrik/ media/ wsgi *.py /opt/webapps/
</pre>

Cobbler Preparation
-------------------

* create the (currently) required xmlrpcuser in cobbler
The default in config.py is xmlrpc/r3dhat01.
as long as they are the same there as in cobbler, all should be well.

* deploy cobbler snippets
These are not packaged with fabrik, as they are site-dependent

* (re)start apache/cobblerd

Test It
-------
in your browser _du jour_, navigate to 
http://yournewserver/apps/fabrik and be amazed.
